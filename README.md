## Features

The Vite + React Memo App offers the following features:

1. **Create Memos**: You can create new memos by clicking the "New Memo" button. Each memo has a title and content.

2. **View Memos**: All created memos are displayed on the main page, allowing you to easily view and access your notes.

3. **Edit Memos**: To make changes to a memo, simply click on the memo you want to edit. You can modify the title and content as needed.

4. **Delete Memos**: If you no longer need a memo, you can delete it by clicking the delete icon next to the memo's title.

5. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

6. **Data Persistence**: Memo data is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`, so your notes will be available even after you close the application or refresh the page.

7. **Search Memos**: There is a search bar at the top that allows you to search for specific memos based on their titles.

8. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: To improve productivity, the application supports keyboard shortcuts for creating new memos and saving changes.
